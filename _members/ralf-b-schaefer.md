Ralf is an aquatic stress ecologist based in Landau, Germany.

## Collaboration statement
I work on the responses of microbial and invertebrate communities, predominantly in freshwater ecosystems, to anthropogenic stressors. I have been involved in assembling an Australian trait database for invertebrates (https://ausrivas.ewater.org.au/index.php/resources2/category/4-software-downloads - see paper: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106280) and I am currently leading a project with to unite aquatic invertebrate databases from different continents .

I can offer expertise in assembling and cleaning trait data from different sources and we have done basic analyses (e.g. on how different decisions to aggregate traits across taxonomic levels affect the outcome of analyses) and am happy to provide data for larger analyses across organism groups. Also would be happy to host visitors in my group and organise meetings, perhaps starting with virtual meetings.
